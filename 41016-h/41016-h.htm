<p><i><span class="smcap">Compilers' Preface.</span></i></p>


<p>The inestimable value of literature in supplying healthful
recreation, in opening the mind to larger views of life, and in
creating ideals that shall mold the spiritual nature, is conceded
now by every one who has intelligently considered the
problems of education. But the basis upon which literature
shall be selected and arranged is still a matter of discussion.</p>

<p>Chronology, race-correspondence, correlation, and ethical
training should all be recognized incidentally; but the main
purpose of the teacher of literature is to send children on into
life with a genuine love for good reading. To accomplish this,
three things should be true of the reading offered: first, it
should be <i>literature</i>; second, it should be literature of some
scope, not merely some small phase of literature, such as the
fables, or the poetry of one of the less eminent poets; and third,
it should appeal to children's natural interests. Children's interests,
varied as they seem, center in the marvelous and the
preternatural; in the natural world; and in human life, especially
child life and the romantic and heroic aspects of mature
life. In the selections made for each grade, we have recognized
these different interests.</p>

<p>To grade poetry perfectly for different ages is an impossibility;
much of the greatest verse is for all ages&mdash;that is one
reason why it <i>is</i> great. A child of five will lisp the numbers of
Horatius with delight; and Scott's <i>Lullaby of an Infant Chief</i>,
with its romantic color and its exquisite human tenderness, is
dear to childhood, to manhood, and to old age. But the Land
of Song is a great undiscovered country to the little child; by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
some road or other he must find his way into it; and these volumes
simply attempt to point out a path through which he may
be led into its happy fields.</p>

<p>Our earnest thanks are due to the following publishers for
permission to use copyrighted poems: to Houghton, Mifflin &amp;
Co. for poems by Longfellow, Whittier, Emerson, Holmes,
Lowell, Aldrich, Bayard Taylor, James T. Fields, Ph&oelig;be Cary,
Lucy Larcom, Celia Thaxter, and Sarah Orne Jewett; to D.
Appleton &amp; Co. for a large number of Bryant's poems: to
Charles Scribner's Sons for two poems by Stevenson, from
<i>Underwoods</i>, and <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i>; to J. B. Lippincott
&amp; Co. for two poems by Thomas Buchanan Read; and to
Henry T. Coates &amp; Co. for a poem by Charles Fenno Hoffman.</p>

<p>The present volume is intended for the seventh, eighth, and
ninth school years, or higher grammar grades. It is the third
of three books prepared for use in the grades below the high
school. As no collection of this size can supply as much poetry
as may be used to advantage, and as many desirable poems by
American writers have necessarily been omitted, we have noted
at the end of this volume lists of poems which it would be well
to add to the material given here, that our children may realize
the scope and beauty of the poetry of their own land.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE QUALITY OF MERCY.</h3>

<span class="i0">The attribute to awe and majesty,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It is enthronÃ¨d in the heart of kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is an attribute to God himself;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earthly power doth then show likest God's<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though justice be thy plea, consider this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, in the course of justice, none of us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that same prayer doth teach us all to render<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How seldom, friend, a good great man inherits<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or throne of corses which his sword hath slain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greatness and goodness are not means, but ends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath he not always treasures, always friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good great man? three treasures&mdash;love and light,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And calm thoughts, regular as infants' breath;<br /></span>

<h3>OZYMANDIAS OF EGYPT.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I met a traveler from an antique land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the pedestal these words appear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hides hills and woods, the river, and the heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And veils the farmhouse at the garden's end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sled and traveler stopped, the courier's feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Out of an unseen quarry evermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curves his white bastions with projected roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round every windward stake, or tree, or door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fanciful, so savage, naught cares he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For number or proportion. Mockingly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A swanlike form invests the hidden thorn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fills up the farmer's lane from wall to wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maugre the farmer's sighs; and at the gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tapering turret overtops the work.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when his hours are numbered, and the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is all his own, retiring, as he were not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished Art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mimic in slow structures, stone by stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Built in an age, the mad wind's night work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frolic architecture of the snow.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We saw the army of the league drawn out in long array;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all its priest-led citizens, and all its rebel peers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Appenzel's stout infantry, and Egmont's Flemish spears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There rose the brood of false Lorraine, the curses of our land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dark Mayenne was in the midst, a truncheon in his hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as we looked on them, we thought of Seine's empurpled flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And good Coligni's hoary hair all dabbled with his blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we cried unto the living God, who rules the fate of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fight for His own holy name, and Henry of Navarre.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The King is come to marshal us, in all his armor drest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He looked upon his people, and a tear was in his eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing to wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down all our line, a deafening shout, "God save our Lord the King!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And if my standard bearer fall, as fall full well he may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For never saw I promise yet of such a bloody fray,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hurrah! the foes are moving! Hark to the mingled din<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roaring culverin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fiery duke is pricking fast across Saint AndrÃ©'s plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and Almayne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of France,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charge for the golden lilies,&mdash;upon them with the lance!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in they burst, and on they rushed, while, like a guiding star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of Navarre.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, God be praised, the day is ours.  Mayenne hath turned his rein.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a Biscay gale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The field is heaped with bleeding steeds, and flags, and cloven mail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then we thought on vengeance, and, all along our van,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Remember St. Bartholomew," was passed from man to man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But out spake gentle Henry, "No Frenchman is my foe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down, down with every foreigner, but let your brethren go."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! was there ever such a knight, in friendship or in war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As our Sovereign Lord, King Henry, the soldier of Navarre?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Right well fought all the Frenchmen who fought for France to-day,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And many a lordly banner God gave them for a prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we of the religion have borne us best in fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the good Lord of Rosny has ta'en the cornet white.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our own true Maximilian the cornet white hath ta'en,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cornet white with crosses black, the flag of false Lorraine.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How God hath humbled the proud house which wrought His church such woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on the ground, while trumpets sound their loudest point of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fling the red shreds, a footcloth meet for Henry of Navarre.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ho! maidens of Vienna; Ho! matrons of Lucerne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weep, weep, and rend your hair for those who never shall return.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That Antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor spear-men's souls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ho! gallant nobles of the League, look that your arms be bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ho! burghers of Saint Genevieve, keep watch and ward to-night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For our God hath crushed the tyrant, our God hath raised the slave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mocked the counsel of the wise, and the valor of the brave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then glory to His holy name, from whom all glories are;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glory to our Sovereign Lord, King Henry of Navarre.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On the sea and at the Hogue, sixteen hundred ninety-two,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Did the English fight the French,&mdash;woe to France!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thirty-first of May, helter-skelter thro' the blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Came crowding ship on ship to St. Malo on the Rance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the English fleet in view.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas the squadron that escaped, with the victor in full chase;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">First and foremost of the drove, in his great ship, Damfreville;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Close on him fled, great and small,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Twenty-two good ships in all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they signaled to the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Help the winners of a race!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Get us guidance, give us harbor, take us quick&mdash;or, quicker still,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here's the English can and will!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leapt on board;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Why, what hope or chance have ships like these to pass?" laughed they:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Rocks to starboard, rocks to port, all the passage scarred and scored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall the <i>Formidable</i> here with her twelve and eighty guns<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Think to make the river mouth by the single narrow way,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Trust to enter where 'tis ticklish for a craft of twenty tons,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And with flow at full beside?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now, 'tis slackest ebb of tide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reach the mooring? Rather say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While rock stands or water runs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a ship will leave the bay!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then was called a council straight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brief and bitter the debate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Here's the English at our heels; would you have them take in tow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that's left us of the fleet, linked together stern and bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a prize to Plymouth Sound?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better run the ships aground!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">(Ended Damfreville his speech.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a minute more to wait!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Let the Captains all and each<br /></span>

<span class="i0">&mdash;A Captain? A Lieutenant? A Mate&mdash;first, second, third?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No such man of mark, and meet<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With his betters to compete!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But a simple Breton sailor pressed by Tourville for the fleet,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As the big ship with a bound,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Up the English come, too late!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, the storm subsides to calm:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They see the green trees wave<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hearts that bled are stanched with balm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Just our rapture to enhance,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How hope succeeds despair on each Captain's countenance!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out burst all with one accord,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"This is Paradise for Hell!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Let France, let France's King<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thank the man that did the thing!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What a shout, and all one word,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He stood upon the world's broad threshold; wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The din of battle and of slaughter rose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw God stand upon the weaker side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sank in seeming loss before its foes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many there were who made great haste and sold<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the cunning enemy their swords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He scorned their gifts of fame, and power, and gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, underneath their soft and flowery words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard the cold serpent hiss; therefore he went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And humbly joined him to the weaker part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fanatic named, and fool, yet well content<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he could be the nearer to God's heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feel its solemn pulses sending blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the widespread veins of endless good.<br /></span>

<h3>SLEEP.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How many thousand of my poorest subjects<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And steep my senses in forgetfulness?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hushed with buzzing night flies to thy slumber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the canopies of costly state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lulled with sound of sweetest melody?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A watch case or a common 'larum bell?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seal up the ship boy's eyes, and rock his brains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In cradle of the rude imperious surge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the visitation of the winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who take the ruffian billows by the top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With deafening clamor in the slippery clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the wet sea boy in an hour so rude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the calmest and most stillest night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all appliances and means to boot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deny it to a king? Then, happy low, lie down!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.<br /></span>

<h3>DORA.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With farmer Allan at the farm abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">William and Dora. William was his son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she his niece. He often looked at them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often thought, "I'll make them man and wife."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Dora felt her uncle's will in all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yearned towards William; but the youth, because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had been always with her in the house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought not of Dora.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Then there came a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Allan called his son, and said, "My son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I married late, but I would wish to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My grandchild on my knees before I die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I have set my heart upon a match.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now therefore look to Dora: she is well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To look to; thrifty too beyond her age.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is my brother's daughter; he and I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had once hard words, and parted, and he died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In foreign lands; but for his sake I bred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His daughter Dora: take her for your wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I have wished this marriage, night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many years." But William answered short:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I cannot marry Dora; by my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will not marry Dora." Then the old man<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Was wroth, and doubled up his hands, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You will not, boy! you dare to answer thus!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in my time a father's word was law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so it shall be now for me. Look to it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consider, William: take a month to think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let me have an answer to my wish;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, by the Lord that made me, you shall pack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never more darken my doors again."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But William answered madly; bit his lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And broke away. The more he looked at her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The less he liked her; and his ways were harsh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Dora bore them meekly. Then before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The month was out he left his father's house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hired himself to work within the fields;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half in love, half spite, he wooed and wed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A laborer's daughter, Mary Morrison.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then, when the bells were ringing, Allan called<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His niece and said, "My girl, I love you well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if you speak with him that was my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or change a word with her he calls his wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My home is none of yours. My will is law."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dora promised, being meek. She thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It cannot be; my uncle's mind will change!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And days went on, and there was born a boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To William; then distresses came on him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And day by day he passed his father's gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heart-broken, and his father helped him not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Dora stored what little she could save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sent it them by stealth, nor did they know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sent it; till at last a fever seized<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
<span class="i0">On William, and in harvest time he died.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then Dora went to Mary. Mary sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked with tears upon her boy, and thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard things of Dora. Dora came and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"I have obeyed my uncle until now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I have sinned, for it was all thro' me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This evil came on William at the first.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, Mary, for the sake of him that's gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for your sake, the woman that he chose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for this orphan, I am come to you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know there has not been for these five years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So full a harvest; let me take the boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will set him in my uncle's eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the wheat; that when his heart is glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the full harvest, he may see the boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bless him for the sake of him that's gone."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Dora took the child, and went her way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was unsown, where many poppies grew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far off the farmer came into the field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spied her not; for none of all his men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dare tell him Dora waited with the child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dora would have risen and gone to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But her heart failed her; and the reapers reaped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But when the morrow came, she rose and took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child once more, and sat upon the mound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made a little wreath of all the flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That grew about, and tied it round his hat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make him pleasing in her uncle's eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when the farmer passed into the field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spied her, and he left his men at work,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And came and said: "Where were you yesterday?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose child is that? What are you doing here?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And answered softly, "This is William's child!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And did I not," said Allan, "did I not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid you, Dora?" Dora said again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Do with me as you will, but take the child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bless him for the sake of him that's gone!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Allan said, "I see it is a trick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Got up betwixt you and the woman there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must be taught my duty, and by you!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You knew my word was law, and yet you dared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To slight it. Well&mdash;for I will take the boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But go you hence, and never see me more."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he took the boy, that cried aloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And struggled hard. The wreath of flowers fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Dora's feet. She bowed upon her hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the boy's cry came to her from the field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More and more distant. She bowed down her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembering the day when first she came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the things that had been. She bowed down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wept in secret; and the reapers reaped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then Dora went to Mary's house, and stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the threshold. Mary saw the boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not with Dora. She broke out in praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To God, that helped her in her widowhood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dora said, "My uncle took the boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, Mary, let me live and work with you:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He says that he will never see me more."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then answered Mary, "This shall never be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And, now I think, he shall not have the boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he will teach him hardness, and to slight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mother; therefore thou and I will go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will have my boy, and bring him home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will beg of him to take thee back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if he will not take thee back again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thou and I will live within one house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And work for William's child, until he grows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of age to help us."<br /></span>
<span class="i10">So the women kissed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each other, and set out, and reached the farm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The door was off the latch; they peeped, and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boy set up betwixt his grandsire's knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thrust him in the hollows of his arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one that loved him; and the lad stretched out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And babbled for the golden seal, that hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Allan's watch, and sparkled by the fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they came in; but when the boy beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mother, he cried out to come to her;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Allan set him down, and Mary said:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"O Father!&mdash;if you let me call you so&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never came a begging for myself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or William, or this child; but now I come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Dora; take her back; she loves you well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Sir, when William died, he died at peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all men; for I asked him, and he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could not ever rue his marrying me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had been a patient wife; but, Sir, he said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he was wrong to cross his father thus;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'God bless him!' he said, 'and may he never know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The troubles I have gone thro'!' Then he turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face and passed&mdash;unhappy that I am!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, Sir, let me have my boy, for you<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Will make him hard, and he will learn to slight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father's memory; and take Dora back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let all this be as it was before."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So Mary said, and Dora hid her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Mary. There was silence in the room;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all at once the old man burst in sobs:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"I have been to blame&mdash;to blame. I have killed my son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have killed him&mdash;but I loved him&mdash;my dear son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May God forgive me!&mdash;I have been to blame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kiss me, my children."<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Then they clung about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man's neck, and kissed him many times.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the man was broken with remorse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all his love came back a hundredfold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for three hours he sobbed o'er William's child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinking of William.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">So those four abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within one house together; and as years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went forward, Mary took another mate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Dora lived unmarried till her death.<br /></span>

<h3>THE RHODORA.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">On Being Asked, Whence is the Flower?</span></h4>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please the desert and the sluggish brook.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The purple petals, fallen in the pool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made the black water with their beauty gay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here might the redbird come his plumes to cool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And court the flower that cheapens his array.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rhodora! if the sages ask thee why<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This charm is wasted on the earth and sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing,<br /></span>

<h3>THE DOWNFALL OF WOLSEY.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bears his blushing honors thick upon him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His greatness is a ripening, nips his root,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This many summers in a sea of glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length broke under me and now has left me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weary and old with service, to the mercy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feel my heart new opened. O, how wretched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favors!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More pangs and fears than wars or women have:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never to hope again.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">O sacred Truth! thy triumph ceased a while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hope, thy sister, ceased with thee to smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When leagued Oppression poured to Northern wars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her whiskered pandoors and her fierce hussars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waved her dread standard to the breeze of morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pealed her loud drum, and twanged her trumpet horn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tumultuous horror brooded o'er her van,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Presaging wrath to Poland&mdash;and to man.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Warsaw's last champion from her height surveyed,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">In vain, alas! in vain, ye gallant few!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From rank to rank your volleyed thunder flew:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, bloodiest picture in the book of Time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sarmatia fell, unwept, without a crime;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found not a generous friend, a pitying foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strength in her arms, nor mercy in her woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dropped from her nerveless grasp the shattered spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closed her bright eye, and curbed her high career;&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A thousand shrieks for hopeless mercy call!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth shook&mdash;red meteors flashed along the sky,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Was yoked in wrath, and thundered from afar?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where was the storm that slumbered till the host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blood-stained Pharaoh left their trembling coast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then bade the deep in wild commotion flow,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ye that at Marathon and Leuctra bled!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friends of the world! restore your swords to man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fight in his sacred cause, and lead the van!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet for Sarmatia's tears of blood atone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make her arm puissant as your own!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! once again to Freedom's cause return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The patriot Tell&mdash;the Bruce of Bannockburn!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yes, thy proud lords, unpitied land, shall see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That man hath yet a soul&mdash;and dare be free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little while, along thy saddening plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The starless night of desolation reigns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Truth shall restore the light by Nature given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like Prometheus, bring the fire of Heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prone to the dust Oppression shall be hurled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her name, her nature, withered from the world.<br /></span>

<h3>THE VILLAGE PREACHER.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Near yonder copse, where once the garden smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still where many a garden flower grows wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The village preacher's modest mansion rose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man he was to all the country dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passing rich with forty pounds a year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remote from towns he ran his godly race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor e'er had changed, nor wished to change, his place;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Unpracticed he to fawn, or seek for power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By doctrines fashioned to the varying hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far other aims his heart had learned to prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More skilled to raise the wretched than to rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His house was known to all the vagrant train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He chid their wanderings, but relieved their pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long-remembered beggar was his guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose beard descending swept his aged breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ruined spendthrift, now no longer proud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Claimed kindred there, and had his claims allowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat by his fire, and talked the night away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wept o'er his wounds, or, tales of sorrow done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouldered his crutch and showed how fields were won.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with his guests, the good man learned to glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quite forgot their vices in their woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careless their merits or their faults to scan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pity gave ere charity began.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even his failings leaned to virtue's side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in his duty prompt at every call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He watched and wept, he prayed and felt for all:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as a bird each fond endearment tries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tried each art, reproved each dull delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Beside the bed where parting life was laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sorrow, guilt, and pain by turns dismayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reverend champion stood: at his control<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his last faltering accents whispered praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At church, with meek and unaffected grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His looks adorned the venerable place;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fools who came to scoff remained to pray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The service past, around the pious man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With steady zeal, each honest rustic ran;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even children followed, with endearing wile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plucked his gown, to share the good man's smile:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ready smile a parent's warmth exprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their welfare pleased him, and their cares distrest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal sunshine settles on its head.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Did he not tremble for this lovely frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This glorious canopy of light and blue?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet 'neath the curtain of translucent dew,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
<span class="i1">Bathed in the rays of the great setting flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hesperus, with the host of heaven, came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo! creation widened in man's view.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who could have thought such darkness lay concealed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Within thy beams, O Sun? or who could find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While fly, and leaf, and insect stood revealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That to such countless orbs thou mad'st us blind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do we then shun death with anxious strife?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If light can thus deceive, wherefore not life?<br /></span>

<h3>FAITH.</h3>

<span class="i0">To which, in silence hushed, his very soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listened intensely; and his countenance soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brightened with joy; for from within were heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmurings, whereby the monitor expressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mysterious union with its native sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even such a shell the universe itself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is to the ear of Faith; and there are times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I doubt not, when to you it doth impart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Authentic tidings of invisible things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ebb and flow, and everduring power;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And central peace, subsisting at the heart<br /></span>

<h3>HYMN BEFORE SUNRISE, IN THE VALE
OF CHAMOUNI.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Hast thou a charm to stay the morning star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his steep course? so long he seems to pause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On thy bald awful head, O sovran Blanc!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ArvÃ© and Arveiron at thy base<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rave ceaselessly; but thou, most awful form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How silently! Around thee and above,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Deep is the air and dark, substantial, black,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ebon mass: methinks thou piercest it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with a wedge! But when I look again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is thy own calm home, thy crystal shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy habitation from eternity!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O dread and silent mount! I gazed upon thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till thou, still present to the bodily sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Didst vanish from my thoughts: entranced in prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I worshiped the Invisible alone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Yet, like some sweet, beguiling melody,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sweet, we know not we are listening to it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou the meanwhile, wast blending with my thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, with my life and life's own secret joy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the dilating soul, enrapt, transfused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the mighty vision passing,&mdash;there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in her natural form, swelled vast to heaven!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Awake, my soul! not only passive praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou owest,&mdash;not alone these swelling tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mute thanks, and secret ecstasy! Awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Voice of sweet song! Awake, my heart, awake!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green vales and icy cliffs, all join my hymn!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Thou first and chief, sole sovran of the vale!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, struggling with the darkness all the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And visited all night by troops of stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or when they climb the sky or when they sink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Companion of the morning star at dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself earth's rosy star, and of the dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coherald! O, wake, and utter praise!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sank thy sunless pillars deep in earth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who filled thy countenance with rosy light?<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>

<span class="i1">And you, ye five wild torrents fiercely glad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who called you forth from night and utter death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From dark and icy caverns called you forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down those precipitous, black, jagged rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever shattered and the same forever?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who gave you your invulnerable life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your strength, your speed, your fury, and your joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unceasing thunder and eternal foam?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who commanded&mdash;and the silence came&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And stopped at once amid their maddest plunge!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Motionless torrents! silent cataracts!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Beneath the keen, full moon? Who bade the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothe you with rainbows? Who, with living flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of loveliest blue, spread garlands at your feet?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"God!" let the torrents, like a shout of nations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answer; and let the ice plains echo, "God!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ye pine groves, with your soft and soullike sounds!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ye lightnings, the dread arrows of the clouds!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye signs and wonders of the elements!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Utter forth God, and fill the hills with praise!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Into the depths of clouds that veil thy breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, too, again, stupendous mountain! thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That as I raise my head, awhile bowed low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In adoration, upward from thy base<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow traveling with dim eyes suffused with tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Solemnly seemest, like a vapory cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rise before me,&mdash;rise, O, ever rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise like a cloud of incense, from the earth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou kingly spirit throned among the hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou dread ambassador from earth to heaven,<br /></span>

<h3>ON FIRST LOOKING INTO CHAPMAN'S
HOMER.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Much have I traveled in the realms of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Round many western islands have I been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft of one wide expanse had I been told<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet did I never breathe its pure serene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then felt I like some watcher of the skies<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When a new planet swims into his ken;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stared at the Pacific&mdash;and all his men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked at each other with a wild surmise&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Silent, upon a peak in Darien.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unequal laws unto a savage race,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vext the dim sea: I am become a name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For always roaming with a hungry heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much have I seen and known; cities of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And manners, climates, councils, governments,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself not least, but honored of them all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drunk delight of battle with my peers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am a part of all that I have met;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Gleams that untraveled world, whose margin fades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever and for ever when I move.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How dull it is to pause, to make an end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rust unburnished, not to shine in use!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As tho' to breathe were life. Life piled on life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were all too little, and of one to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little remains: but every hour is saved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that eternal silence, something more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bringer of new things; and vile it were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For some three suns to store and hoard myself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this gray spirit yearning in desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To follow knowledge like a sinking star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This is my son, mine own Telemachus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom I leave the scepter and the isle&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This labor, by slow prudence to make mild<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free hearts, free foreheads&mdash;you and I are old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old age hath yet his honor and his toil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death closes all: but something ere the end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some work of noble note, may yet be done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Push off, and sitting well in order smite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the western stars, until I die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' much is taken, much abides: and tho'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are not now that strength which in old days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.<br /></span>

<h3>ANTONY'S EULOGY ON C&AElig;SAR.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I come to bury CÃ¦sar, not to praise him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The evil that men do lives after them;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good is oft interrÃ¨d with their bones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So let it be with CÃ¦sar. The noble Brutus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath told you CÃ¦sar was ambitious:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it were so, it were a grievous fault,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grievously hath CÃ¦sar answered it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Brutus is an honorable man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So are they all, all honorable men&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come I to speak in CÃ¦sar's funeral.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was my friend, faithful and just to me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Brutus says he was ambitious;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Brutus is an honorable man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hath brought many captives home to Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did this in CÃ¦sar seem ambitious?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When that the poor have cried, CÃ¦sar hath wept:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Brutus is an honorable man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You all did see that on the Lupercal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thrice presented him a kingly crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sure, he is an honorable man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here I am to speak what I do know.<br /></span>

<h3>ON THE RECEIPT OF MY MOTHER'S
PICTURE.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">O that those lips had language! Life has passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me but roughly since I heard thee last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those lips are thine&mdash;thy own sweet smile I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same that oft in childhood solaced me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Voice only fails, else how distinct they say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Grieve not, my child, chase all thy fears away!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The meek intelligence of those dear eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Blest be the art that can immortalize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The art that baffles Time's tyrannic claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To quench it) here shines on me still the same.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Faithful remembrancer of one so dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O welcome guest, though unexpected here!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who bidd'st me honor with an artless song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Affectionate, a mother lost so long.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will obey, not willingly alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But gladly, as the precept were her own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while that face renews my filial grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fancy shall weave a charm for my relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall steep me in Elysian reverie,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A momentary dream, that thou art she.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My mother! when I learned that thou wast dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hovered thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wretch even then, life's journey just begun?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps thou gav'st me, though unfelt, a kiss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah that maternal smile! it answers&mdash;Yes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard the bell tolled on thy burial day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, turning from my nursery window, drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But was it such?&mdash;It was.&mdash;Where thou art gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May I but meet thee on that peaceful shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The parting word shall pass my lips no more!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy maidens, grieved themselves at my concern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft gave me promise of thy quick return.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What ardently I wished, I long believed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, disappointed still, was still deceived.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By expectation every day beguiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dupe of <i>to-morrow</i> even from a child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus many a sad to-morrow came and went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, all my stock of infant sorrow spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I learned at last submission to my lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, though I less deplored thee, ne'er forgot.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where once we dwelt our name is heard no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Children not thine have trod my nursery floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the gardener Robin, day by day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew me to school along the public way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delighted with my bauble coach and wrapped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In scarlet mantle warm, and velvet cap,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis now become a history little known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That once we called the pastoral house our own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short-lived possession! but the record fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That memory keeps of all thy kindness there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still outlives many a storm, that has effaced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand other themes less deeply traced.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy nightly visits to my chamber made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou might'st know me safe and warmly laid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy morning bounties ere I left my home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The biscuit; or confectionery plum;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fragrant waters on my cheeks bestowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By thy own hand, till fresh they shone and glowed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this, and more endearing still than all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy constant flow of love, that knew no fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne'er roughened by those cataracts and breaks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That humor interposed too often makes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this still legible in memory's page,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still to be so to my latest age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adds joy to duty, makes me glad to pay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such honors to thee as my numbers may;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps a frail memorial, but sincere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not scorned in Heaven, though little noticed here.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Could Time, his flight reversed, restore the hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, playing with thy vesture's tissued flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The violet, the pink, and jessamine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pricked them into paper with a pin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And thou wast happier than myself the while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wouldst softly speak, and stroke my head, and smile),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could those few pleasant days again appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might one wish bring them, would I wish them here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would not trust my heart&mdash;the dear delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems so to be desired, perhaps I might,&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But no&mdash;what here we call our life is such,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So little to be loved, and thou so much,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I should ill requite thee to constrain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy unbound spirit into bonds again.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thou, as a gallant bark from Albion's coast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The storms all weathered and the ocean crossed),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoots into port at some well-havened isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where spices breathe, and brighter seasons smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There sits quiescent on the floods, that show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her beauteous form reflected clear below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While airs impregnated with incense play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around her, fanning light her streamers gay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So thou, with sails how swift! hast reached the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where tempests never beat, nor billows roar,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy loved consort on the dangerous tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of life long since has anchored by thy side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But me, scarce hoping to attain that rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Always from port withheld, always distressed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me howling blasts drive devious, tempest-tossed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sails ripped, seams opening wide, and compass lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And day by day some current's thwarting force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sets me more distant from a prosperous course.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet O the thought, that thou art safe, and he!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thought is joy, arrive what may to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My boast is not, that I deduce my birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From loins enthroned, and rulers of the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But higher far my proud pretensions rise&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son of parents passed into the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, farewell&mdash;Time unrevoked has run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wonted course, yet what I wished is done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By contemplation's help, not sought in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seemed to have lived my childhood o'er again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have renewed the joys that once were mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without the sin of violating thine;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And, while the wings of Fancy still are free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I can view this mimic show of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time has but half succeeded in his theft&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself removed, thy power to soothe me left.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Accompanying, the sad chariot-bier<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past like a shadow thro' the field, that shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full summer, to that stream whereon the barge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Palled all its length in blackest samite, lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There sat the lifelong creature of the house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loyal, the dumb old servitor, on deck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winking his eyes, and twisted all his face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So those two brethren from the chariot took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the black decks laid her in her bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set in her hand a lily, o'er her hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silken case with braided blazonings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed her quiet brows, and saying to her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sister, farewell for ever," and again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Farewell, sweet sister," parted all in tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then rose the dumb old servitor, and the dead,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In her right hand the lily, in her left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The letter&mdash;all her bright hair streaming down&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the coverlid was cloth of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn to her waist, and she herself in white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All but her face, and that clear-featured face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was lovely, for she did not seem as dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fast asleep, and lay as tho' she smiled.<br /></span>

<h3>WATERLOO.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There was a sound of revelry by night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Belgium's capital had gathered then<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A thousand hearts beat happily; and when<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Music arose with its voluptuous swell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all went merry as a marriage bell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Did ye not hear it?&mdash;No; 'twas but the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or the car rattling o'er the stony street;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On with the dance! let joy be unconfined;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To chase the glowing hours with flying feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But hark!&mdash;that heavy sound breaks in once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As if the clouds its echo would repeat;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arm, arm! it is&mdash;it is&mdash;the cannon's opening roar!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Within a windowed niche of that high hall<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sate Brunswick's fated chieftain; he did hear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That sound, the first amidst the festival,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And when they smiled because he deemed it near,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His heart more truly knew that peal too well<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And there were sudden partings, such as press<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which ne'er might be repeated: who could guess<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And there was mounting in hot haste: the steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And near, the beat of the alarming drum<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or whispering with white lips&mdash;"The foe! They come! they come!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And wild and high the "Cameron's gathering" rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The war note of Lochiel, which Albyn's hills<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have heard, and heard, too, have her Saxon foes:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Savage and shrill! But with the breath which fills<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their mountain pipe, so fill the mountaineers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the fierce native daring which instills<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The stirring memory of a thousand years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Evan's, Donald's fame rings in each clansman's ears!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Dewy with Nature's tear drops, as they pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Over the unreturning brave,&mdash;alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ere evening to be trodden like the grass<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which now beneath them, but above shall grow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In its next verdure, when this fiery mass<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of living valor, rolling on the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And burning with high hope, shall molder cold and low.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Last noon beheld them full of lusty life,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Last eve in beauty's circle proudly gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The midnight brought the signal sound of strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The morn the marshaling in arms,&mdash;the day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Battle's magnificently stern array!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The thunder clouds close o'er it, which when rent<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The earth is covered thick with other clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rider and horse,&mdash;friend, foe,&mdash;in one red burial blent!<br /></span>
